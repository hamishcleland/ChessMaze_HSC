# ChessMaze_HSC
A Chess Maze Created as Part of an Assessment for a C# Course

The objective of the game is to get to the coloured square by moving to other chess pieces. You cannot move to blank squares.

This project contains the code for two seperate playable chess maze game views, one built from the drag and drop and editor and the built programatically. The two versions are functionally the same.
